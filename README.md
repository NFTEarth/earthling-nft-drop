# NFTEarth Earthling collection drop

A lazy-minted ERC-721 NFT collection of 4,444 Earthlings. This collection will be a primary driver of the NFTEarth ecosystem for providing utility and token gated access; and also work in tandem with the NFT collateralized vaults to be developed in conjunction with lending protocols, yield aggregators, and liquid staking protocols in order to deliver ERC-4626 on Arbitrum; for both **lower costs** and **increased diversification** for both lenders and borrowers.

## Tools used to Build

Thirdweb
React
TypeScript
Vercel
